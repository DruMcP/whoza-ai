    question: "How much does AI call answering cost for plasterers?",
    answer: `whoza.ai starts at <a href="/pricing" className="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">plans start at £59/month</a> for the Starter plan. That's less than one room skim. You get unlimited AI call answering, WhatsApp delivery, and a 7-day free trial with no credit card required. Most plasterers recover the cost within a week by capturing just one missed job.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI call answering work?",
    answer: `Katie uses advanced AI to answer your business calls 24/7, capture customer details, and send structured alerts to your WhatsApp. Read our <a href="/blog/ai-call-answering-uk-tradespeople-definitive-guide-2026" className="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">complete guide to AI call answering</a> for UK trades to learn more.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can Katie handle builder and developer enquiries?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Katie is trained to recognise builder and developer enquiries and tags them as priority in your WhatsApp alert. She captures project size, timeline, property type, and referral source — so you know it's a £3,500 full house re-skim before you even call back.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information does Katie collect from plastering customers?",
    answer: "Katie captures: full name, phone number, postcode, property type (house/flat/commercial), job type (skimming, rendering, dry lining, plaster repair, coving, screeding), room count or area size, timeline, builder/referral source, urgency level, and preferred appointment time. For emergencies, she also asks about damage extent and accessibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will customers know they're talking to AI?",
    answer: "Katie introduces herself as your digital assistant with a natural, professional voice. Most callers appreciate the instant response over voicemail or a ringing phone. In user surveys, 89% of callers are satisfied with the AI experience — they just want their walls smooth and ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work with my existing business phone number?",
    answer: "Yes. You simply set up call forwarding from your existing plastering business number to your whoza.ai number. Your customers dial the same number they've always used — Katie just answers when you can't. Setup takes under 10 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can I get set up?",
    answer: "Most plasterers are live and capturing calls within 30 minutes. Sign up, connect your number via call forwarding, set your greeting and business details, and Katie starts answering immediately. No hardware, no IT team, no technical knowledge required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Katie handle emergency plaster repair calls?",
    answer: "Yes. Katie answers 24/7 including nights, weekends, and bank holidays. She identifies emergency keywords like 'crack', 'water damage', 'blown plaster', 'ceiling collapse' — then marks the enquiry as emergency priority in your WhatsApp alert. You see it immediately and can call back within minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if Katie can't handle a complex enquiry?",
    answer: "Katie is trained to recognise when a call needs human attention. For complex quotes or unusual situations, she takes a detailed message and flags it for your immediate callback. You receive the full context in WhatsApp so you can call back prepared with all the details.",
