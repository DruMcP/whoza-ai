    question: "How much does AI call answering cost for plumbers?",
    answer: "whoza.ai starts at £59/month for the Starter plan. That's less than one emergency callout fee. You get unlimited AI call answering, WhatsApp delivery, and a 7-day free trial with no credit card required. Most plumbers recover the cost within 48 hours by capturing just one missed job.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Katie handle burst pipe emergencies at 2am?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Katie answers 24/7 including nights, weekends, and bank holidays. She identifies emergency keywords like 'burst pipe', 'flooding', 'no water', and 'leak through ceiling' — then marks the enquiry as emergency priority in your WhatsApp alert. You see it immediately and can call back within minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information does Katie collect from plumbing customers?",
    answer: "Katie captures: full name, phone number, postcode, property type (house/flat/commercial), problem description (burst pipe, boiler breakdown, blocked drain, leak), urgency level, preferred appointment time, and how they found you. For emergencies, she also asks about water shut-off status and property damage extent.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will customers know they're talking to AI?",
    answer: "Katie introduces herself as your digital assistant with a natural, professional voice. Most callers appreciate the instant response over voicemail or a ringing phone. In user surveys, 89% of callers are satisfied with the AI experience — they just want their leak fixed fast.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work with my existing business phone number?",
    answer: "Yes. You simply set up call forwarding from your existing plumbing business number to your whoza.ai number. Your customers dial the same number they've always used — Katie just answers when you can't. Setup takes under 10 minutes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can I get set up?",
    answer: "Most plumbers are live and capturing calls within 30 minutes. Sign up, connect your number via call forwarding, set your greeting and business details, and Katie starts answering immediately. No hardware, no IT team, no technical knowledge required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Katie book plumbing appointments directly into my calendar?",
    answer: "Yes. Katie checks your connected calendar availability and offers specific time slots to customers. When they confirm, the appointment is saved to your calendar and both parties receive confirmation. You can also tap 'Accept' or 'Call Back' in your WhatsApp alert to manage enquiries manually.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if Katie can't handle a complex plumbing enquiry?",
    answer: "Katie is trained to recognise when a call needs human attention. For complex quotes or unusual situations, she takes a detailed message and flags it for your immediate callback. You receive the full context in WhatsApp so you can call back prepared with all the details.",
